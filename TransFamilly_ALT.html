          <h2>TransFamily Support Services</h2>
          <h5>RESEARCH / UX DESIGN / WEB BUILDING</h5>
        </div>
        <p>
          As part of UC San Diego's Design Co 10 week summer design and marketing initiative, Build Up, my team was paired with TransFamily Support Services. TransFamily Support Services is a San Diego based LGBT non-profit that aims to be a one stop shop for helping transgender youth navigate through their journey. We saw that their current website lacks identity and is disorganized due to the use of basic typefaces, being difficult to navigate, and can do more in terms of personability and connecting to their audience.

      <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
      <div class="case-paragraph">
        <h3>Web Audit</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing we did was an initital audit of the site in order to identify at a glance some issues with the site. We based our audit off of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">usability heuristics</a> from NNgroup.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          We also conducted a competitive analysis to gain some inspiration on how to fix initial issues we saw with the site.

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <div class="case-paragraph">
        <h3>Surveys & Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          We interviewed and surveyed a total of 30 users to gather usability insights for us, and demographic information for the organization. When asked about the website, we found that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            60% had a hard time understanding <strong> what TransFamily Support Services is</strong> from their website.
          </li>
          <li>
            60% had difficulty finding <strong>events</strong> and <strong>services</strong> offered.
          </li>
          <li>
            The navigation bar on the side of the website is <strong>unintuitive</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The labels on the navigation bar are <strong>vague</strong> and <strong>unclear</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Affinity Map</h3>
        <p>
          We also created an affinity map based on insights and grouped them by difficulties users encountered from tasks. this allowed us to visualize data and identify trends.

      <p>TRANSLATING USER RESEARCH INTO A PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>
      <h3>How might we create <strong>a more accessible online identity</strong> for TransFamily Support Services in order to increase <strong>discoverability</strong> and <strong>provide more support for transgender and nonbinary individuals as well as their loved ones</strong>?</h3>

      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
      <div class="case-paragraph">
        <p>
          One of the main things I wanted to tackle was the information architecture of the site since <strong>over 60%</strong> of users expressed issues regarding navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made multiple site maps and incorporated stakeholder feedback to redo the navigation of the site.

        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>
          The client expressed they wanted a rebrand, but wanted to stay close to the colors of the Transgender flag. To help visualize this, we created a moodboard based off the colors of the Transgender flag.
        </p>
        <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="">
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we could visualize our brand, we brought it to life by creating a style guide with typography, colors, buttons, and other reusable components. This ensured designs were consistent across the site and allowed developers to easily componentize everything.

      <h2>High Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
      <div class="case-paragraph">
        <p>
          Based on elements from our design system, we created high fidelity prototypes with visual elements and content fully incorporated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then presented our designs to stakeholders and conducted final rounds of testing to finalize our designs before implementation.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        We implemented the webpages on Wordpress, the organization's web builder of choice. We also created components for elements on our style guide. This made it so the site is easily scalable and our client can pick up where we left off.

      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        If given more time and resources to work with TransFamily Support Services, we would:
        <ol>
          <li>Thoroughly plan out components for A/B testing</li>
          <li>Include more usability tests for our final round of validation</li>
          <li>Implement remaining website pages, navigation bar, and footer</li>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <div class="takeaways">
        <h3>Design is a bumpy road</h3>
        <p>The process of designing beautiful experiences can be anything but beautiful. Embrace the chaos and jump at every opportunity to improve. </p>
        <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
        <p>Whether it be with stakeholders or other group members, communication and trust at every step of the way led to efficient and effective progress. </p>
        <h3>Deadlines are Crucial</h3>
        <p>Setting dates for when we wanted to have deliverables finished held group members accountable and ensured we progressed (even if it was all mostly done the night before). </p>
        <h3>Get Feedback</h3>
        <p>Our end product was greatly improved thanks to feedback from our mentors (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarreatolbert/">Tarrea Tolbert</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexalexlili/">Alex Li</a>, & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chytumalad/">Chynna Tumalad</a>), our TFSS point of contact (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspen-everhart-ba9815ba/">Aspen Everhart</a>), and other builders.</p>
