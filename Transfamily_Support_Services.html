        <h2>TransFamily Support Services</h2>
        <p>
          As part of UC San Diego's Design Co 10 week summer design and marketing initiative, Build Up, my team was paired with TransFamily Support Services. TransFamily Support Services is a San Diego based LGBT non-profit that aims to be a one stop shop for helping transgender youth navigate through their journey

      <p>
        We had a lot to learn about the site and industry including information architecture, possible usability heuristics that are violated, and how the site stacks up compared to other non-profits.

          After learning an adequate amount about the site, we moved on to user research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who primarily visits the site? What do people who visit the site want to accomplish? How do people navigate through the site? Can we improve event engagement through the site?
        </p>
        <p>
          We went to work interviewing and surveying users in hopes of finding answers to these questions.

      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we had user research out of the way, we could start brainstorming and ideating on screens for the website. As a team, we did a mind map and crazy 8s to rapidly formulate and organize ideas.

        <p>
          One major thing I wanted to tackle was the information architecture of the site. As it currently stood, the site was largely unorganized as revealed by our usability tests and stakeholders. I created more site maps in an attempt to address this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I created a site map V2 as a first attempt at reorganizing the site with their current navigation bar. I made an effort to reduce clutter and moved pages around based on usability testing insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          After deliberation with stakeholders, we decided to scrap the current navigation bar and include an events section to officially give events a home as well as a donate button to promote funding.

      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        With research and ideation out of the way, we could finally focus on the design portion of the project. One of the first things we did was make wireframes as a quick and easy method of testing screen features and layouts.

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p>
        Since we were doing a major overhaul of the website, we also needed to tackle branding. We started this off by creating mood board around the transgender flag colors since the organization expressed interest in these colors.

        Based on elements from our design system as well as our wireframes, we made hi-fi prototypes for major pages in the site for usability testing and implementation purposes.

        We conducted Usability testing on our hi-fidelity prototypes to ensure the site was easy to navigate and usable. We used the insights from this usability test to create the final form of our navigation bar.

          <li>Thoroughly plan out components for A/B testing</li>
          <li>Include more usability tests for our final round of validation</li>

      <div class="takeaways">
        <h3>Design is a bumpy road</h3>
        <p>The process of designing beautiful experiences can be anything but beautiful. Embrace the chaos and jump at every opportunity to improve. </p>
        <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
        <p>Whether it be with stakeholders or other group members, communication and trust at every step of the way led to efficient and effective progress. </p>
        <h3>Deadlines are Crucial</h3>
        <p>Setting dates for when we wanted to have deliverables finished held group members accountable and ensured we progressed (even if it was all mostly done the night before). </p>
        <h3>Get Feedback</h3>
        <p>Our end product was greatly improved thanks to feedback from our mentors (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarreatolbert/">Tarrea Tolbert</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexalexlili/">Alex Li</a>, & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chytumalad/">Chynna Tumalad</a>), our TFSS point of contact (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspen-everhart-ba9815ba/">Aspen Everhart</a>), and other builders.</p>
