          <h2>TransFamily Support Services</h2>
          <h5>RESEARCH / UX DESIGN / WEB BUILDING</h5>
          <p>
            TransFamily Support Services is a San Diego based LGBT non-profit that aims to be a one stop shop for helping transgender youth navigate through their journey. We saw that their current website lacks identity and is disorganized due to the use of basic typefaces, being difficult to navigate, and can do more in terms of personability and connecting to their audience. 
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <section class="case-section">
      <div>
        <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
        <p>
          Before mocking up designs or conducting any formal research, we needed to understand the current site and any issues it may have. This gave us a sense of direction and allowed us to estimate the scope of our project.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Web Audit</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing we did was an initial audit of the site in order to identify at a glance some issues with the site. We based our audit off of <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">usability heuristics</a> from NNgroup.

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>
          After identifying some initial issues, we needed to understand our users and how they interact with the site. We performed user research in the form of surveys and interviews.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-paragraph-alt">
        <h3>Surveys & Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          We interviewed and surveyed a total of 30 users to gather usability insights for us, and demographic information for the organization. When asked about the website, we found that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            60% had a hard time understanding <strong> what TransFamily Support Services is</strong> from their website.
          </li>
          <li>
            60% had difficulty finding <strong>events</strong> and <strong>services</strong> offered.
          </li>
          <li>
            The navigation bar on the side of the website is <strong>unintuitive</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The labels on the navigation bar are <strong>vague</strong> and <strong>unclear</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="div-before-img">
        <h3>Affinity Map</h3>
        <p>
          We also created an affinity map based on insights and grouped them by difficulties users encountered from tasks. this allowed us to visualize data and identify trends.

      <p>TRANSLATING USER RESEARCH INTO A PROBLEM STATEMENT</p>

        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <div class="case-paragraph">
          <p>
            One of the main things I wanted to tackle was the information architecture of the site since <strong>over 60%</strong> of users expressed issues regarding navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created multiple site maps and incorporated stakeholder feedback to redo the navigation of the site.

        <h2>Visual Elements</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we had a solid foundation of research, some early prototypes of screens, and an idea of what we wanted we to fix, we needed to consider how we wanted the site to look visually. Not only this, but we all needed to be on the same page so that the site maintained consistency across pages.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="div-before-img">
        <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>
          The client expressed they wanted a rebrand, but wanted to stay close to the colors of the Transgender flag. To help visualize this, we created a moodboard based off the colors of the Transgender flag.

      <div class="div-before-img">
        <h3>Style Guide</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we could visualize our brand, we brought it to life by creating a style guide with typography, colors, buttons, and other reusable components. This ensured designs were consistent across the site and allowed developers to easily componentize everything.

            Based on elements from our design system, we created high fidelity prototypes with visual elements and content fully incorporated.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then presented our designs to stakeholders and conducted final rounds of testing to finalize our designs before implementation.

              We wanted to make a landing page that encapsulates all of what TransFamily Support Services does and what makes them unique. We also included testimonials and a form that recommends resources for personability.

              Their current who we are page is not descriptive enough and doesn't give any insight into who is behind the organization. Thus, we completely revamped the page to showcase the humans who make the organization run.

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          We implemented the webpages on Wordpress, the organization's web builder of choice. We also created components for elements on our style guide. This made it so the site is easily scalable and our client can pick up where we left off.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          If given more time and resources to work with TransFamily Support Services, we would:
          <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly plan out components for A/B testing</li>
            <li>Include more usability tests for our final round of validation</li>
            <li>Implement remaining website pages, navigation bar, and footer</li>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="takeaways">
          <h3>Design is a bumpy road</h3>
          <p>The process of designing beautiful experiences can be anything but beautiful. Embrace the chaos and jump at every opportunity to improve. </p>
          <h3>Communication is Key</h3>
          <p>Whether it be with stakeholders or other group members, communication and trust at every step of the way led to efficient and effective progress. </p>
          <h3>Deadlines are Crucial</h3>
          <p>Setting dates for when we wanted to have deliverables finished held group members accountable and ensured we progressed (even if it was all mostly done the night before). </p>
          <h3>Get Feedback</h3>
          <p>Our end product was greatly improved thanks to feedback from our mentors (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarreatolbert/">Tarrea Tolbert</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexalexlili/">Alex Li</a>, & <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chytumalad/">Chynna Tumalad</a>), our TFSS point of contact (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspen-everhart-ba9815ba/">Aspen Everhart</a>), and other builders.</p>
