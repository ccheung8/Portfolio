          <h2>Boba Bar</h2>
          <h5>UX DESIGN / VISUAL DESIGN / WEB DEVELOPMENT</h5>
          <p>
            Boba Bar and Desserts is a local business in San Diego that specializes in serving bubble tea and puffles. They have over 4000 followers on Instagram and over 1000 reviews on Yelp. Although they have established themselves on social media, they still lack a website. During initial requirements gathering, it was clear that they needed a website that allows their current and future customers to easily learn about their business, browse their menu, and find out how to order for pick-up and delivery. 
          </p>
        </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
        <p>
          Since the client didn't have a pre-existing website, a lot of our preliminary work involved looking at other sites and looking at their already established base of customers.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-paragraph div-before-img">
        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing we did on this project was conduct competitive analysis to see what works and doesn't work on sites that have a similar business model. This allowed us to make educated decisions as well as gain inspiration on different components of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listed below are some main competitors we decided to analyze.

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>
          We went through reviews on sites like Yelp and Google and highlighted trends we saw. We then translated these trends into personas for easy consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          We came up with three personas for three different user demographics: Job Seeker, Potential Customer, & the Caterer.

        <h3>Feasibility vs. Functionality Chart</h3>
        <p>
          We created a feasibility vs. functionality chart for the pages and components that we planned on having on the site. As the UX Engineer, I helped determine the feasibility of many components for implementation.

        Boba Bar and Desserts needs a <strong>visually appealing</strong> website that reflects their <strong>business values</strong> while allowing customers to <strong>view menu items</strong> in order to <strong>establish themselves online</strong> and <strong>more directly connect with current and future customers</strong>.

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          With research out of the way, we could start ideating and making early prototypes. We went through countless iterations and incorporated feedback at every step of the way.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          While waiting for the client to supply us with content and imagery, we went to work on making layouts without visual elements or content incorporated. This allowed us to start thinking about layouts and get initial feedback.

        <h2>Visual Elements</h2>
        <p>
          With the ideas for some of our screens out of the way, we could start thinking about visual elements and how they could be incorporated into our prototypes. We made a mood board and created a scalable design system for the site.

      <div class="div-before-img">
        <h3>Mood Board</h3>
        <p>
          Before incorporating visual elements, we made a mood board to visualize the look and feel we wanted to go for. We based it off of Boba Barâ€™s social media posts and any other artifacts we could find.

              We made the menu page with the goal of emphasizing ease of ordering. We also included an easily accessible pdf menu and a filtering option for different menu categories. Puffles were emphasized as a novelty item since many tea items were deemed as self explanatory.

          The catering and career pages were made with embedded HTML forms. The client originally expressed that they wanted an embedded google form, but after iterations and communicating with our client, we settled on an embedded HTML forms as they are more visually appealing and better for usability.

            <li>Fine tune microcopy and content.</li>

          <h3>Developers are Stakeholders</h3>
          <p>
            As the UX Engineer on this project, Iâ€™ve learned that developers are another stakeholder that should be considered when designing.
          </p>
          <h3>Constraints Drive Creativity</h3>
          <p>
            There were many constraints we faced throughout the project. Whether it be team, client, or design constraints, they pushed us to be more creative in order to overcome them.
          </p>
          <h3>Humans are More than Users</h3>
          <p>
            Designing for humans is complicated, but thatâ€™s the appeal of UX Design.
